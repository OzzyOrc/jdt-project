= Traverse Java Code

== Setup HOW-TO
From the command line:

----
./gradlew build                                # Build the source
./gradlew eclipse                              # Generate eclipse project
./gradlew fatjar                               # Generate a jar file (this takes a while)
java -jar build/libs/jdt-project-1-0.0.1.jar . # Run the program from the command line
----

Then, in Eclipse, go to 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into Workspace' and look for this project.
